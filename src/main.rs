/*

This is only a learning Project. It's only for me to learn to work with OpenGL
I just want to make my result, an animated 3d Cube, public. It's not going to be a
revolutionary Project in any way or form, as I said it's only for learning.
This dev branch has currently nothing to do with the finished "Project" as I don't
even know how to use OpenGL.
